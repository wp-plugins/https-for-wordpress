This plugin is a full featured private post management interface. It allows you to manage all private post's publishing status via the "Manage" admin menu.

== Description ==

This plugin will make sure that all elements on a page are SSL if the page is being accessed via HTTPS. For this to happen you must have used correct programming practices and use siteurl, wpurl, url etc where all the locations are supposed to be. 

Some plugins do not correctly use this, I have already notified a few of them, but you may find some other issues.

== Installation ==

* Upload to your 'wordpress/wp-content/plugins'</li>
* Enable the plugin in your admin section</li>
	
That's it you're done!
